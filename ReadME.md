# Smart-Freezer-Monitor
Alerts the owner when a freezer is kept open for long or when the temperature in the freezer keeps rising

Our main application is to preserve the contents of a walk-in freezer and household refrigerator.
Breakdown of freezer in a household refrigerator will result in wastage of food. 
Food waste is a colossal social, environmental, and economic issue. Food wastage is a global problem. Food waste isnâ€™t just a big picture problem. When your business model relies on fresh, delicious, and safe to eat food, optimizing your entire cold chain to keep things at the right temperature is your first priority. All it takes is an open freezer door forgotten by a distracted employee.  A considerable amount of food is discarded by households in India. Many publications addressing the issue thus far, propose changes of consumer behaviour as the solution to fighting food waste. This article explores the possible contribution of technology, in particular, alerting the consumer when his/her refrigerator breaks down or is kept open too long which would eventually lead in wastage of food.
So to solve this problem and to maintain the constant temperature, we are building this system.

Conclusion - 
The results obtained after the execution of our project determines that our product will alert the user when the temperature of the freezer crosses a particular threshold value or the freezer is kept open for some time.
 This will ensure that the contents of the freezer(food) remain fresh instead of getting wasted. 
Also can be used for monitoring Chiller Plants for Server Rooms.Organizations will experience less network failures
